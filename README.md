# Predicting Nitrogen Pollution in the Chesapeake Bay
-----------------------
## [What are important factors impacting Total Nitrogen in the Chesapeake Bay?](https://github.com/teamHackTheBay/hackTheBay)
**Key Skills**
* Correlation Plots
* Geospatial Analysis (Geopandas, QGIS, geopy)
* Feature Engineering
* Data Wrangling
* SHAP & Permutation Feature Importance
* Ensemble Modeling

**<ins> WINNING ENTRY :</ins> A social good hackathon hosted by Booz Allen Hamilton & Chesapeake Monitoring Cooperative (CMC) to explore data monitoring the health of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The challenge was to create a predictive model & correlation analysis for explaining patterns found from condition measures expressed by water quality indicator(s) assessments in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The judging criteria were based upon robustness, scalability, and creativity by 16 expert judges representing leadership from 7 organizations and expertise across environmental science and modeling, data science, machine learning, and human-centered design.
The task was to build a predictive model or correlation analysis for pollution in a section of the Chesapeake Bay using CMC monitoring data.**

**Key Skills**
* K-Means
* PCA - Principle Component Analysis
* Silhouette Method
* Elbow Sum of Squares Method

**Mini project on customer segmentation and identifying unkown relationships among customers. The more you know of your customers, the more you can personalize your service! The dataset contains information on marketing newsletters/e-mail campaigns (e-mail offers sent) and transaction level data from customers (which offer customers responded to and what they bought).**

# Exploratory Data Analysis' (EDA)
--------------------------------
**Several EDA's performed on varying data categories.**
## [Hospital Readmittance Data](https://github.com/bryan-md/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Hospital%20Readmit%20EDA)
**Hospital Readmittance performs a statistical analysis on a previously done analysis to critique its validity. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began reducing Medicare payments for Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospitals with excess readmissions. The analysis focuses on Hospital readmittance data analysis.**
## [Human Temperature Data](https://github.com/bryan-md/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Human%20Body%20Temp%20EDA)
**Human Temperature EDA uses bootstrap statistics to determine the true average temperature of the human body in both male and females.**
## [Racial Discrimination Data](https://github.com/bryan-md/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Racial%20Discrimination%20Using%20EDA)
**Racial Discrimination performs a statistical analysis on if race has a meaningful impact on the callback rate of callbacks for resumes.**
